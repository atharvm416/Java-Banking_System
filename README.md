The system is built with Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, JTree, JTable, JDialog, JLabel, JTextField, etc. The system has 3 sections: Account, Transaction, and Display, each with a JDialog window in 8 separate packages to create, delete, modify, transfer, and present account details stored in the Microsoft Access database. The Java program is linked to a Microsoft Access (.mdb/.accdb) database using JDBC and an ODBC driver.
